  This subdirectory contains 2 programs for calculating the bottom elevation
  as a function of time. Both programs read the data file for the location of the 
  trailing edge of the elliptical slider as a function of time, TimeTx.dat. This file
  could be any of the data files in subdirectories of the data folder. The file 
  TimeTx.dat included here is renamed from TimeTx_SG5_IS4_0p01.dat. The programs 
  contain a driver program that calls a subroutine that could be included in an 
  arbitrary hydrodynamics program.
  
  Program Landslide_geometry82.f90 calculates the bottom elevation for an elliptical
  slider that replicates the laboratory experiment.
  
  Program Landslide_geometry83.f90 is similar but smoothes the ends of the slider
  for depth-averaged non-hydrostatic simulators or other codes as required.
