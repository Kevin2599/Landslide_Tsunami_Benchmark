  Data for each experiment is contained in the subdirectories and is identified using
  the notation in the documentation. SG denotes specific gravity where 1 is the  lowest
  and 5 is the highest. IS denotes initial submergence where 1 is the deepest and 5 is 
  the shoalest. See Langford Sue's PhD thesis for further details.

  Within each subdirectory are three main data files and four folders containing MATLAB
  routines to extract the data. Many of the m files have been converted for Octave, an
  open source program similar to Matlab. The data files are:
    
    TimeTx_SGx_ISy_0p01.dat specifies the location of the trailing edge of the slider as a
    function of time with timestep 0.01 second.
    
    profile_SGx_ISy.dat contains the data to plot the water elevation at specific times
    as shown in the figures in Appendix C.2 of the thesis. 
    
    timeseries_SGx_ISy.dat contains the data to plot the time history of water elevation 
    at specific sites as shown in the figures in Appendix C.3 of the thesis.
